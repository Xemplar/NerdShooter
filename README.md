## Creating Levels

Creating Levels is easy using our tool linked above, however if you want to use a text editor instead of our tool, here
are a few rules you have to follow:

- All blocks must be separated by a comma.
- All Entities have the following format: eXX#OX1#OX2..#OXN
  Where XX refers to entity ID,
  OX1 refers to first Option,
  OX2 refers to second Option,
  OXN refers to last Option.
